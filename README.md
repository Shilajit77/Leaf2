## Overview of the project

The main objective of this project is proposing a system for detecting leaf diseases using different deep learning models. The system utilizes these deep learning models to classify the images of leaves into healthy or diseased categories and identify its disease. However, since a single deep learning model may not be always accurate and a differently and better trained model may give better results, so we have used the concept of ensemble learning to improve accuracy, precision and recall. We have created an interface which allows users to use different model to detect the diseases. The results demonstrate that the ensembled model achieves comparable accuracy,precision and recall to the larger teacher model, while requiring less computational resources and time.
